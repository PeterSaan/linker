## Starting project

**Make sure you have docker installed**

- Clone repo
- Run in project root `cp ./backend/.env.example ./backend/.env` 
- If you are running the project for the first time `docker-compose up --build -w` otherwise you can run `docker-compose watch`  
    - Note if there are any package changes etc, you will have to run `docker-compose up --build -w` again
